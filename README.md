🏛️ House of Consequences

Decision Lifecycle Archive – Commercial Prototype

House of Consequences on web-pohjainen kaupallinen prototyyppi, joka toteuttaa Seurausten talo -mallin ohjelmistomuodossa.

Se on tarkoitettu organisaatioille, jotka tarvitsevat keinon dokumentoida, tarkastella ja säilyttää päätösten seuraukset ajassa, ei pelkästään päätöksiä itseään.


# What this product is

House of Consequences is a decision lifecycle documentation tool.

It enables organizations to:
	•	record significant decisions
	•	track their effects and consequences over time
	•	preserve institutional memory
	•	prevent structural forgetting

This repository contains a commercial prototype, not an open framework.


# Conceptual foundation

The software is based on the Seurausten talo (House of Consequences) decision lifecycle model:
	1.	Decision
	2.	Impact
	3.	Consequences
	4.	Adaptation
	5.	Accumulation
	6.	Normalization

The model itself is conceptual and institutional.
This repository implements it as a product.


# What the prototype includes
	•	Decision case creation (single-case MVP)
	•	Structured lifecycle input (6 phases)
	•	Visual lifecycle preview
	•	Automatic Case ID generation
	•	PDF export for archiving and audits
	•	Local-first storage (browser-based)
	•	Single-file deployment (index.html)

No backend. No user accounts. No analytics.
This is intentional.


# Intended users
	•	Companies (strategy, compliance, risk management)
	•	Public sector organizations
	•	NGOs and foundations
	•	Auditors and evaluators
	•	Research and policy units
