🏛️ House of Consequences

Decision Lifecycle Archive – Commercial Prototype

House of Consequences on web-pohjainen kaupallinen prototyyppi, joka toteuttaa Seurausten talo -mallin ohjelmistomuodossa.

Se on tarkoitettu organisaatioille, jotka tarvitsevat keinon dokumentoida, tarkastella ja säilyttää päätösten seuraukset ajassa, ei pelkästään päätöksiä itseään.


# What this product is

House of Consequences is a decision lifecycle documentation tool.

It enables organizations to:
	•	record significant decisions
	•	track their effects and consequences over time
	•	preserve institutional memory
	•	prevent structural forgetting

This repository contains a commercial prototype, not an open framework.


# Conceptual foundation

The software is based on the Seurausten talo (House of Consequences) decision lifecycle model:
	1.	Decision
	2.	Impact
	3.	Consequences
	4.	Adaptation
	5.	Accumulation
	6.	Normalization

The model itself is conceptual and institutional.
This repository implements it as a product.


# What the prototype includes
	•	Decision case creation (single-case MVP)
	•	Structured lifecycle input (6 phases)
	•	Visual lifecycle preview
	•	Automatic Case ID generation
	•	PDF export for archiving and audits
	•	Local-first storage (browser-based)
	•	Single-file deployment (index.html)

No backend. No user accounts. No analytics.
This is intentional.


# Intended users
	•	Companies (strategy, compliance, risk management)
	•	Public sector organizations
	•	NGOs and foundations
	•	Auditors and evaluators
	•	Research and policy units
  

# Technical structure

This is a static web prototype:

Runs directly in any modern browser.
Deployable via GitHub Pages or internal servers.

## Canonical Clause


## Canonical Casebook Clause

The Canonical Casebook is not a framework, methodology, or standalone specification.

It is a product-defined, versioned, and validated constitutional core of the
House of Consequences Governance system.

“Canonical” in this context refers exclusively to casebooks that:
• conform to the official Canonical Casebook schema,
• pass the governance-level validation rules,
• and are processed within the House of Consequences Governance product.

Any reference, implementation, or derivative that exists outside this product
cannot claim canonical status, regardless of structural similarity.

The Canonical Casebook cannot be separated, reused, or rebranded independently
of House of Consequences Governance.


⚖️ EULA / SaaS – Canonical Term Protection


Canonical Casebook is a protected product term.

The term “canonical” may not be used to describe any casebook, schema,
implementation, or derivative work unless it is validated and operated within
the official House of Consequences Governance product.

The Canonical Casebook, including its structure, validation logic, and
governance constraints, may not be:
• extracted,
• replicated,
• reverse engineered,
• or used in a competing commercial product
without explicit written license.

Violation constitutes unauthorized competitive use of proprietary functionality.


🧱 Governance Constitution – Arkkitehtuurilukko


The Canonical Casebook exists to prevent narrative manipulation, attribution
collapse, and propagandistic reduction of complex decision systems.

For this reason:
• validation is enforced at the system level,
• incomplete decision lifecycles are rejected,
• normalized states are mandatory,
• and individual-level blame attribution is structurally disallowed.

These constraints are architectural, not contractual.
They are not optional and cannot be disabled by users, clients, or operators.

Governance is enforced by design.
