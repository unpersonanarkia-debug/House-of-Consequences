# House of Consequences  
## Commercial & Enterprise Overview

*House of Consequences* is a structured decision-lifecycle system designed for organizations that need to *retain institutional memory*, *trace decision consequences over time*, and *prevent structural amnesia* in governance, policy, and strategy.

This repository contains a *commercial prototype* intended for evaluation, pilot programs, and licensed deployment in professional environments.


## What Problem Does This Solve?

Modern organizations suffer from a recurring structural failure:

- Decisions are made
- Justifications are documented
- Consequences emerge later
- Responsibility dissolves
- Memory resets

House of Consequences introduces a *formal lifecycle model* that makes decisions traceable across time, regardless of personnel changes, political cycles, or organizational restructuring.


## Core Concept

Every significant decision moves through a *six-phase lifecycle*:

1. *Decision* – A choice is made and recorded
2. *Impact* – Immediate effects appear
3. *Consequences* – Secondary and long-term outcomes emerge
4. *Adaptation* – Organization adjusts behavior and structures
5. *Accumulation* – Effects compound and stabilize
6. *Normalization* – Outcomes become “the new normal”

The system is designed to *close the loop*, ensuring that normalization feeds back into future decision-making rather than erasing history.


## Intended Use Cases

House of Consequences is suitable for:

- Corporate governance & board decisions
- Public-sector policy tracking
- Regulatory compliance & audit trails
- Strategic transformation programs
- Institutional learning & risk analysis
- Post-mortem and foresight analysis


## What This Repository Contains

This repository provides:

- A *web-based prototype interface*
- A *structured decision capture model*
- A *visual lifecycle representation*
- A *PDF-exportable documentation format*
- A *local-first evaluation architecture*

It is intentionally *technology-light* to allow adaptation into:
- Internal systems
- Secure intranets
- Policy tooling
- Enterprise platforms


## Licensing Model

This repository is *not open-source*.

It is released under a *Commercial / Evaluation License*, allowing:

- Internal evaluation
- Proof-of-concept deployment
- Pilot programs

*Prohibited without a commercial agreement:*

- Production deployment
- Redistribution
- SaaS offering
- Derivative commercial products

➡️ LICENSE-ENTERPRISE.md


## Separation of Model and Software

House of Consequences distinguishes between:

- *The conceptual decision model*  
- *The software implementation*

The model may be licensed independently of the software, allowing:

- Policy adoption without tooling
- Integration into existing systems
- Customized implementations

This separation is intentional and foundational.


## Roadmap (Indicative)

Planned commercial extensions include:

- Multi-case repositories
- Role-based access control
- Institutional dashboards
- Audit-grade exports
- API-based integrations
- Decision dependency graphs
- Longitudinal analysis tools


## Evaluation & Commercial Contact

For:
- Enterprise pilots
- Licensing discussions
- Institutional adoption
- Custom deployments

Contact details will be provided upon request.


*House of Consequences*  
Because decisions do not disappear — they accumulate.
