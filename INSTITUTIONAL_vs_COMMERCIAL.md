# Institutional vs Commercial Boundary Document  
## House of Consequences / Seurausten talo

This document defines the *clear conceptual, legal, and operational boundary*
between:

- *Seurausten talo* (Institutional / public-interest framework)
- *House of Consequences* (Commercial / licensed implementation)

The separation is intentional and non-negotiable.


## 1. Purpose of Separation

The House of Consequences ecosystem is built on two parallel but distinct layers:

| Layer | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Institutional | Preserve public-interest thinking, transparency, and conceptual openness |
| Commercial | Provide deployable, supported, and licensed implementations |

This separation ensures:
- intellectual clarity
- ethical defensibility
- legal enforceability
- commercial scalability


## 2. Seurausten talo (Institutional Layer)

### 2.1 Nature

Seurausten talo is:

- a *conceptual framework*
- a *public-interest analytical model*
- a *non-commercial reference structure*

It exists to:
- describe decision lifecycles
- expose consequence accumulation
- support civic, academic, and institutional understanding

### 2.2 Characteristics

- Non-commercial
- Non-exclusive
- Openly inspectable
- Educational and analytical
- No warranties
- No operational guarantees

### 2.3 Typical Use

- Academic research
- Public sector discussion
- Civic education
- Conceptual critique
- Non-operational demonstrations

Seurausten talo *does not*:
- provide enterprise features
- guarantee correctness
- offer support or SLAs
- function as a production system


## 3. House of Consequences (Commercial Layer)

### 3.1 Nature

House of Consequences is:

- a *commercial product family*
- a *licensed implementation*
- an *operational system*

It exists to:
- operationalize decision lifecycle tracking
- enable institutional memory
- support audits, governance, and compliance
- reduce organizational forgetting

### 3.2 Characteristics

- Licensed
- Versioned
- Supported
- Auditable
- Deployable in production environments

### 3.3 Typical Use

- Enterprises
- Governments
- NGOs
- Regulated institutions
- Long-term decision accountability environments

House of Consequences *does*:
- include contractual terms
- define liability boundaries
- include support options
- enforce usage scope


## 4. Intellectual Relationship

| Aspect | Institutional | Commercial |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Conceptual model | Open | Implemented |
| Visual language | Reference | Production-grade |
| Decision lifecycle | Abstract | Enforced |
| Responsibility | Interpretive | Contractual |
| Memory | Conceptual | Operational |

The commercial product is *inspired by*, but *not identical to*, the institutional framework.


## 5. Legal Boundary

- Institutional materials are *not licensed for commercial deployment*
- Commercial use requires:
  - explicit license
  - signed order form
  - acceptance of commercial terms

No implied rights exist.


## 6. Ethical Boundary

The institutional layer preserves:
- critique
- dissent
- transparency

The commercial layer enforces:
- accountability
- traceability
- responsibility

Neither replaces the other.


## 7. Branding & Naming Rules

- *“Seurausten talo”* refers to the institutional framework
- *“House of Consequences”* refers to the commercial system

They must not be used interchangeably in contracts, sales material, or deployments.


## 8. Non-Substitution Clause

Use of the institutional framework does *not* substitute:
- legal compliance
- professional judgment
- governance responsibility

Use of the commercial system does *not* replace:
- ethical reasoning
- political accountability
- institutional decision-making authority


## 9. Summary

| Seurausten talo | House of Consequences |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Public-interest model | Commercial product |
| Conceptual | Operational |
| Open | Licensed |
| Interpretive | Enforced |
| Educational | Deployable |

The boundary is deliberate.
The separation is permanent.
The coexistence is essential.

House of Consequences — because decisions accumulate.
