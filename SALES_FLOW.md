# Sales Flow  
## House of Consequences

This document defines the *standard commercial sales flow* for House of Consequences,
from first contact to long-term deployment.

The flow is designed to support:
- institutional buyers
- regulated environments
- long decision cycles

## 1. Entry Points

A potential customer typically enters the sales flow through one of the following:

- Conceptual exposure (Seurausten talo – institutional layer)
- Demonstration site or prototype
- Direct inquiry (email / referral)
- Pilot proposal
- Regulatory or audit-driven need

At this stage:
- no commercial commitments exist
- no deployment rights are granted


## 2. Qualification Phase

### Objectives
- Understand organizational context
- Identify decision-accountability pain points
- Confirm suitability

### Key Questions
